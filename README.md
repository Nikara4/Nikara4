- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Aleksandra. I have finished my React course and am now expanding my knowledge with Node.js and MERN applications. I aim at becoming a Front-End or Full-Stack Developer (with React and Node.js mostly).

- You will find here my first projects done in HTML5 and CSS3 (eg. My Resume page), JavaScript (eg. my WebDev Portfolio), miscellaneous excercises from courses (repository 'misc-code-excercises) and my newest projects done in React and MERN. Main field of previous working experience: Administration, Client Service, Research, Background Screening.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in many things, actually. I am always trying to find THE THING, but there are so many fascinating smaller things. So I love watching TV shows; mostly sci-fi, some romance, fasntasy, a little drama. I love Marvel, Star Wars, Disney and Harry Potter stuff. I'd love to learn how to dance lindy hop and travel a lot. I'm also into healthy lifestyle, you know: diet, excercise and well-weing.
