If you are new to coding and would like to start your journey with front-end or full-stack in JavaScript, you can check out my Learning Guide: [Frontend_beginners_guide](https://github.com/Nikara4/Frontend_beginners_guide)

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Aleksandra. My base coding language is JavaScript, but I have also finished a React course. My knowledge has expanded with Node.js and MERN applications. My dream is to become a Front-End or Full-Stack Developer (with React and Node.js mostly), but I am also open to new challenges and skills. I am thinking of learning Angular, Python or something else in the future.

- Here you will find my first projects done in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript (eg. My Resume page or WebDev Portfolio), miscellaneous excercises from courses (repository 'misc-code-excercises or repositories starting with 'SW_') and my newest projects done in React and MERN (IT Memes World). My main field of previous working experience: Administration, Client Service, Research, Background Screening.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in many things, actually. I am always trying to find THE THING, but there are so many fascinating smaller things. So I love watching TV shows; mostly sci-fi, some romance, fasntasy, a little drama (mostly Korean or Chinese). I love Marvel, Star Wars, Disney and Harry Potter stuff. You can basically say that I am a true nerd. Apart from that, I'd love to learn how to dance lindy hop or classics, and travel a lot. I'm also into healthy lifestyle, you know: diet, excercise and well-weing.
