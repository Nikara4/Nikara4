- 👋 Hi, I’m @Nikara4, a Front End and Web Developer wannabe. 

- 👀 I’m interested in many things, actually. I am always trying to find THE THING, but there are so many fascinating smaller things. So I love watching TV shows; mostly sci-fi, some romance, fasntasy, a little drama. I love Marvel, Star Wars, Disney stuff. I'd love to learn how to dance lindy hop and travel a lot. I'm into healthy lifestyle, you know: diet, excercise and well-weing. That's mostly because I need it to feel at least slightly comfortable.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML 5, CSS and JavaScript. This list will expand as I go. Right now I am working on my portfolio site, which will later consist of other projects.
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking to collaborate, but I would love to find a mentor.
